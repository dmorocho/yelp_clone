# yelp_clone

Thanks for checking out my Yelp-Clone. My site allows users to have access to core Yelp functionalities. Users are able to search for topics or restaurants that are in the NYC area. You are able to sort and filter to your liking. Reviews are displayed on each individual restaurant page along with some more relevant information. Users can then leave a review once signed in.

Technologies
This full-stack application app has been developed with a frontend and backend using the technologies aligned below.

Backend: For my Database, I have opted to use Postgress. To create routes to my backend Express and helper packages body-parser, cors. This enabled me to create get, post, and patch routes. The backend was then deployed to Heroku. 

Frontend: For my frontend, I have decided to use React-Redux ToolKit. This frame wire has been set up to encompass core components with their state under each corresponding folder. For routing, I used react-router-dom that let me set up individual webpages as well as pass ids throughout the app. For user login and signup I decided to use Google's firebase that allowed for better security. This was married all together using core CSS and Material-UI for the design. 



Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, Happy Searching!
